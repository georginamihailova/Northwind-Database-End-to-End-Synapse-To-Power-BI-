## Project Overview

This project is centered on analyzing data from the Northwind Database using Power BI. The goal was to gain insights into product performance, customer behavior, and overall business efficiency.

## Step 1: Preparing the Data

The process began by preparing the data from the Northwind Database. Initially, I uploaded raw CSV files into Azure's Data Lake and transformed them into a more efficient Parquet format. These files were then structured into external tables, setting the stage for deeper analysis.

## Step 2: Building Relationships Between Tables

To make the data more useful, I created views that join relevant tables. For example, I combined the Orders and Order Details tables to get a complete view of each transaction. I also linked products with their categories and created tables to manage regions and territories.

## Step 3: Importing Data into Power BI

Once the data was organized and cleaned, I imported it into Power BI. Power BI allowed me to create interactive dashboards and reports, making it easier to analyze trends, compare metrics, and draw meaningful conclusions.

## Step 4: Creating the Data Model and Visualizations in Power BI

Using the relationships established earlier, I built a data model in Power BI to address key business questions. This model facilitated the creation of interactive dashboards, which allowed me to analyze various aspects such as overall sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. Through these visualizations, I was able to explore specifics like year-over-year sales performance and average order values, turning raw data into actionable insights for better decision-making.
